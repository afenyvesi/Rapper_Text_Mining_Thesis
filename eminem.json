have at least a half a million for my baby girl\nIt may be early to be planning this stuff\nCause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough\nCause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough\nI've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed\nMy hands have been cuffed\nBut I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff\nOr plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts\nI'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough\nAnd I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see\nMy destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased\nWith my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese\nI'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call\nWay before my baby is able to crawl\nI'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates\nTo know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades\nI seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth\nWhere they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q\n\n[Eye-Kyu:]\n[Chorus:]\nIt's a broke day but everything is ok (It's

mouth\nWishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse\nIn this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts\nWith the root of all evil\nI've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful\nAnd make them do shit illegal\nFor these Grant's and Jackson's\nThese transactions explain a man's actions\nBut in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity \nThrough God and there's a wish he granted me\nHe showed me how to cope with the stress\nAnd hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed\nAlways groping a mess, of flying over the nest\nTo selling dope with the rest\nI quit smoking cess to open my chest\nLife is stressful inside this cesspool \nTrying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel\nMy little brother's trying to learn his mathematics\nHe's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts\nKids attract static, children with automatics\nTaking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets\nI'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum\nI won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum\nIt's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth\nBut it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth\n\n[Eye-Kyu:]\n[Chorus:]\nIt's a broke day but

filled with fans, packed to capacity\nI'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty\nIf he's acting soft and he cowers\nHe better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers\nYou flowers got no clout with a thing\nYou could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang\nI shout the slang, simple as A,B,C's\nSkip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's\nDethrone MC's and I'ma max alone\nRelax your dome like a solo from a saxophone\nSo facts are known, writers get treated with shocks\nI rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks\nI'm

there for me\nIf you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)\nCause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be\nYour man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed\nThis is easily

flash in front of my eyes\nI felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs\nNone of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed\nThen I remembered the flashlight in my costume\n\n[Chorus:]\nI make you

to be broke as fuck\n\n[Verse One:]\nI feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net\nI'm popping percocets, I'm a nervous wreck\nI deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check\n'Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\nFull of venom and rage\nEspecially when I'm engaged\nAnd my daughter's down to her last diaper\nThat's got my ass hyper\nI pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer\nWatching ballers while they're flossing in their pathfinders\nThese overnight stars becoming autograph signers\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\nAlong with the small fry's and average half pinters\nWhile player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas\n'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us\nMoney'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless\nWhile snakes slither in the grass spineless\n\n[Chorus (2x):]\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen this life makes you're mad enough to kill\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen you want something bad enough to steal\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen you feel like you've had it up to here\n'Cause you're mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear\n\n[Verse Two:]\nMy life is full of empty promises\nAnd broken dreams\nI'm hoping things will look up\nBut there ain't no job openings\nI feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished\nLiving in this house with no furnace, unfurnished\nAnd I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay\nAnd I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play\n'Cause when we die we know we're all going the same way\nIt's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man\nPlus a luxury sedan\nToo comfortable and roomy in a six\nBut they threw me in the mix\nWith all these gloomy lunatics\nWho walk around depressed\nAnd smoke a pound of ses a day\nAnd yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThere's people that love me and people that hate me (yup)\nBut it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady\nI want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame\nThat means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames\nThat means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name\nThere's lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\n'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom\nI got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em (I'm done)\nI'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em\nHolding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em\nAnd the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em\nAnd while you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them\nI got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want

touched, so much anger aimed,\nIn no particular direction, just sprays and sprays.\nAnd straight through your radio waves it plays and plays,\n'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days.\n\nWho would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair\nWith some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear,\nThat I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?\nHow could I

white,\nNo labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like\n\"Fuck it!\" until I met Dre, the only one to look past,\nGave me a chance, and I lit a fire up Under his ass,\n\nHelped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got\nWas probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got,\nLike damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow,\nI'm like my skin is just

they connected with me too because I looked like them,\n\nThat's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope,\nSearchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope\nWaitin' to choke\nTightening around my throat,\nWatching me while I write this,\nLike I don't like this,\nNope,\n\nAll I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy,\nSponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early\nSurely hip-hop was never a problem\nIn Harlem\nOnly in Boston,\nAfter it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom,\n\nSo now I'm catchin' the flak\nFrom these activists when they raggin',\nActin' like I'm the first rapper\nTo smack a bitch, or say \"faggot\",\n\nShit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal,\nThe posterchild,\nThe motherfuckin' spokesman now for...\n\nWhite

Hollywood\n{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n{Why do I feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n\n[Verse 1]\nI thought I had it all figured out, I did\nI thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim\nBut I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once\nI found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs\nWhich should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave\nHow come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me\nNobody couldn't see the shit I felt\nKnowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me\nThe minute shit was heated she just bailed\ni'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself\nI couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell\nTurned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt\nSaw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground\nI just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail\nI'm not about to lose my freedom over no female\nI need to slow down\nTry to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n[Verse 2]\nBury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look\nAt nothin', this world's too much\nI've swallowed all I could\nIf I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good\nJust say goodbye to Hollywood\nI probably should, these problems are piling all at once\nCause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up\nI think i'm bottomin' out\nBut i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up\nThank God, I got a little girl\nAnd I'm a responsible father\nSo not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud\nMust be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it\nAll I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad\nCause I hate him so bad\nThe worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man\nIf you could understand why I am the way that I am\nWhat do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em i'm...\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it\nFor me to have this much appeal like this is sick\nThis is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick\nPublicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick\nFuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats\nIf I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass\nI love my fans\nBut no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have\nI never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack\nThis is more than I ever could of asked\neverywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask\nWhat about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that\nIt's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped\nIf I could go back, I never woulda rapped\nI sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back\nI just wanna leave this game with level head intact\nImagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',\neverything blow up and all you did was just grow\nup emceeing\nIt's fuckin' crazy\nCause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had\nBut instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n[Outro]\nGoodbye, goodbye Hollywood, {Goodbye},\nplease don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,\n{this shit is not for me},\nso goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,\n{i'm not a fuckin' star},\nplease don't cry for me, when

Perhaps\nI'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.\n\nMusic is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when you're real\nAnd you spit and people are feeling your shit.\nThis is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it\n'Cause you may never get it again.\n\nSo while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can\nAnd when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.\n'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.\nI got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.\n\nIt goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.\nBut in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me.\n\nThat's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.\nEven though half you people got a fucking problem with me.\nYou hate it but you know respect you've got to give me\nThe press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate, hit me.\n\n[Nate Dogg]\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.\n'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high?

Perhaps\nI'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.\n\nSoon as a verse starts I eat it at MC's heart\nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word.\nI'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve\n\nBut I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.\n'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.\nThat's why I'm clever when I put together every verse\n\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict\nI rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.\nBut I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.\n\nSo this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at them\nThe track is on some battling raps who want some static\n'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters\nA plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

does not even know me\nEven though he sees me everywhere he goes\nSo he just tortures himself\nHe has no fortune and wealth\nSo he extorts someone else to get his dough\nAnd now he's acting like a bully\nSo he tries to push and pull me\nBut he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad\nHe has no choice but to scream\nAnd raise his voice up at me\nCause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared\n\nYou ain't no motherfucking (bully)\nAnd I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)\nI won't allow it, ain't gonna cower to no (bully)\nI'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)\nFight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)\nAnd I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)\n\nNow I'm not trying to make no more enemies\nNo more unfortunately\nThere's so many other motherfuckers that just are\nThey just keep hounding at me\nNow that I'm down with 50\nSuddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja [laughter]\nBut his ass is such a puppet\nIrv could shove his whole hand up it\nAnd just make him say what he wants him to say\nBut Suge has Irv's on a string\nAnd Irv's so nervous that he\nSays anything to this man to keep him at bay\nSo now Ja thinks that he's so tough\nAnd Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf\nAnd they go huff and puff and blow our label down\nBut our building's made out of bricks\nSo you ain't taking out shit\nAnd dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown\nSo now you try to pull the race card\nAnd it backfires in your face hard\nCause you know we don't play that black and white shit\nPlus this stylist that you fucked\nWhen you was ecstasied up\nWas just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch\n\nYou must be taking to much (E...)\n\nNow what bothers me the most\nAbout hip-hop is we so close\nTo picking up where we left off with Big and Pac\nWe just lost Jam Master J\nBig L got blasted away\nPlus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah\nIt's like a never-ending cycle\nThat just seems to come full circle\nEverybody's gotta be so fucking hard\nI'm not excluding myself\nCause I been stupid as well\nI been known to lose it when someone says something smart\nBut as we grow as men\nWe learn to let shit go, but then again\nThere's only so much bullshit we can really stand\nWe all got reps to uphold\nWhen someone steps on our toes\nIt's no exception, it goes for every man\nBut if Irv really gave a fuck\nAbout Ja like he claims he does\nHe'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs\nBut he just keeps feeding him pills\nSo if that E doesn't kill him\nSomeone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed\nDawg, I'm talking to you straight\nIf the situation escalates\nAny worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game\nAnd if I get killed for this rap\nI got a million in cash\nThat says I will get you back in Hailie's name\n\nIrvine, get your boy off that (E...)\n\n[Spoken:]\nGet at me, dog\nHolla"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/comeonin.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album":

it off at the park that was the half-way mark\nTo meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark\nTo sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's\nThat's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps\nAt Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows\nAt Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime\nHe looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, \"White boys don't know how to rhyme.\"\nI spit out a line and rhymed \"birthday\" with \"first place\"\nAnd we both had the same rhymes that sound alike\nWe was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined\nFrom that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line\n\nSo let's go

that day at school\nIt was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through\nAnd said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops\nIt was rumors but man, god damn, they flew\nMust've been true because man we done banned they shoes\nI had the new ones the Cool J, Ice Lamb suede too\nBut we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news\nGuess who came through next, X-Clan debut\nProfessor X vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green\nWith a key sissies now with this being a new trend\nWe don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums\nBlackness is in, African symbols and medallions\nRepresents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant\nMe and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em\nAll over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all\nWe was being laughed at \"You ain't even half black.\"\nYou ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that\nAnd that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that\nAll I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement\nSaying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan's tape is\nWhich reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time\nShe was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl\nAt our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me\nAnd oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus\nThe same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs\nThe bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull her\nNot only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time\nBut it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy\nAnd that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the \"Oh Foolish Pride\" girl\nBut I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad\nBut it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize\nI was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe\n\nSo let's go back\nFollow the yellow

show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\nEven if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\nI'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\nI'm supposed to set an example\nI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\nThere's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object for someone to get killed\nWhy would I wanna destroy something I help build\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin'\nAnd that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\nAnd talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\nWhile he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life\nLike fuck it i understand this is business\nAnd this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\nAnd wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\nBut now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\nThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\nIt's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\nFuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\nWell fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\nBut I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\nThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nThat's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nWe'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\nTo have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThen to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man\nIf ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\nCause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause\n\n[Chorus]"}, {"url":

tell you?\nStraighten up little soldier\nStiffen up that upper lip\nWhat you crying about?\nYou got me.\n\nHailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad\nWhen I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\n'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?\nDaddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\nDaddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?\nYeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world\nWhen it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls\nTwo little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze\nI know it's confusing you\nDaddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us\nI don't see us ever being together ever again\nLike we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\n(Ha)\nIt's funny\nI remember back one year when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\nAnd stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me\n'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in\nEither kept getting broken into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\nAnd flew you and momma out to see me\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainnie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah\nIt's got a ring to it don't it?\nShh, mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me to\nDaddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"}, {"url":

my pen is to my pad\nThe moral, the very fiber\nThe whole substance to my rap.\n\nYou are my reason for being\nThe meaning of my existence\nIf it wasn't for you\nI would never be able to spit this\nAs intense as I do and the irony\nIs you rely on me as much\nAs I rely on you to inspire me like you do.\n\nYou provide me the lighter fluid\nYou're fuel to my fire\nYou're my entire supply\nGas, the match and igniter.\n\nThe only way that I am able\nTo stay so stable\nIs you're the legs to my table\nIf you were to break I'd fall on my face.\n\nBut I'm always gonna make you feel\nI don't need you

his wife\nThere she is on the ground being trampled\nI go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her\nGod damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit\nMy vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin\nIf I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee\nFollow Bizarre's path ran through it\nMade it to the front door and collapsed on the steps\nLooked up and I seen Swift shooting it out\nBut I can't see who he's shooting it out with\nBut Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four-fifth\n\n[Eminem:]\nOne shot two shot three shots four shots\nAll I hear is gunshots\nThis is where the fun stops\nBodies drop, hit the floor\nMusic's off, party stops\nEverybody hit the door\nSomebody's licking shots off\n\n[Kon Artis:]\nIt's Friday night came to this bitch right\nBig ass in my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right\nI ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight\nAlthough I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight\nThat's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge\nShot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in\nSwift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this schmuck\nThat shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker\nSo one shot for the money two's to stop the show\nThird's for the bartender\n(bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')\nI just wanna know who's driving the black Mitsubishi\nHe tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece\n\n[Eminem:]\nOne shot two shot three shots four shots\nAll I hear is gunshots\nThis is where the fun stops\nBodies drop, hit the floor\nMusic's off,

drop it on the record (what)\nWe gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)\nThat's why we always save the best cut last\nTo make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut

can play the back and forth all day\nLike the hot potato game, thats why we came to\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Eminem]\n50 cent, come on!\n\n[50 Cent]\nBounce now, hands up, you know how we do\nWe make the club

[2 guns cock]\nYou ready? 1.. 2.. 3! [2 shots]\n\n[Chorus]\nThe more you, put me through,\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you,\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more,\nYou don't want me, I just want you more,\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,\nI know it's sad but it's making me happy,\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,\nCause you love me, and I love you more.\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's sick, but who could ever predict,\nWe'd be doin' the same shit,\nWe say we do it for our baby but we don't,\nWe do it for us, it's lust,\nCause neither one of us trusts each other,\nSo we fuck 'til we bust,\nThen we cuss each other, out,\nWe know what it's about,\nShout 'til I throw you out the house,\nYou throw me out the house,\nI throw you on the couch,\nPunch you in the mouth,\nFist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,\nAnd apologize after,\nLaughter, pain, it's insane,\nWe're back in the same chapter again,\nAnd it's sad but it's true,\nWhen I'm layin' here with you,\nThere ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nCause I hate you, do you hate me?\nGood cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,\nIt makes me wanna just take you,\nAnd just throw you on the bed,\nAnd fuck you like I don't even know you,\nYou fuck other people, and I fuck other people,\nYou a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,\nWe're both evil in our ways,\nBut neither one of us would ever admit it,\nCause one of us would have one up on the other,\nSo forget it,\nWe can make accusations, people spread rumors,\nBut they ain't got proof,\n'Til they do it's just the two of us,\nIt's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,\nBut you gotta believe me to a degree,\nCause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,\nYeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,\nIf I ran who would I run to,\nThat would be this soft and warm,\nSo it's off and on, usually more off than on,\nBut at least we know that we share this common bond,\nYou're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,\nI hope, the only reason that I cope,\nIs cause of that fact,\nAnd plus I can bust in that,\nAnd that's why...\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI could never understand it,\nThat's why I don't try,\nFrom junior high until we both die,\nIt's silly ho why must we try,\nIs it really so rough,\nThat we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,\nTry to pull each other's legs,\nUntil the other begs,\nWe're liein' to ourselves,\nThat's the beauty of it yeah,\nCause we truly love each other,\nThat's why we always fight,\nAnd all we do is shove each other,\nEvery other fuckin' night,\nAnd it's clear it ain't gonna change,\nIt's pent up rage,\nWe both have,\nWe both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,\nWe've both been,\nSomeone else's someone else,\nProblem is neither one wants help,\nIt's an addiction and it can't be fixed,\nOur family's mixed up,\nThere's a baby sister in the mix,\nAnd it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,\nAnd anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,\nAnd they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,\nOn every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,\nAll the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,\nWhat you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,\nBut I won't be made a fool of,\nIf this is true love,\nYou wouldn't do what,\nYou did last time,\nYou wouldn't screw up,\nThis time,\nCause this time girl,\nI'm telling you what,\nYou do it again I'm fucking you up,\nNo matter what...\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat you say, what you do,\nI'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,\nNo matter where you run, I'll be right there,\nRight behind you, in your nightmares,\nAll the flowers, and the candy,\nAll the times that you threw it back at me,\nYou told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,\nWhen you find out, can't escape me whore.\n\n[Chorus]"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/rickytickytoc.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album": "\"Encore\"",

'round the outside, 'round the outside\n\nGuess who's back, back again\nShady's back, tell a friend\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\nGuess who's back\n\nI've created a monster\n'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more\nThey want Shady I'm chopped liver\nWell if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya\nA little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor\nSome vodka that'll jump-start my heart\nQuicker than a shock\nWhen I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor\nWhen I'm not cooperating\nWhen I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)\n\nYou waited this long now stop debating\n'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating\nI know that you got a job Ms. Cheney\nBut your husband's heart problem's complicating\n\nSo the FCC won't let me be\nOr let me be me so let me see\nThey try to shut me down on MTV\nBut it feels so empty without me\n\nSo come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that\nCum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy\nI just settled all my lawsuits\nFuck you, Debbie!\n\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n\nLittle hellions kids feeling rebellious\nEmbarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis\nThey start feeling like prisoners, helpless\n'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells \"bitch\"\n\nA visionary, vision is scary\nCould start a revolution\nPolluting the air waves a rebel\nSo just let me revel and bask\nIn the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass\nAnd it's a disaster\nSuch a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass\nYou ask for me?\n\nWell I'm back\nFix your bent antennae\nTune it in and then I'm gonna enter in\nAnd up under your skin like a splinter\nThe center of attention back for the winter\n\nI'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling\nInfesting in your kid's ears and nesting\nTesting attention please\nFeel the tension soon as someone mentions me\nHere's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free\nA nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?\n\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n\nA tisk-it a task-it\nI'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit\nChris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked\nWorse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards\n\nAnd Moby\nYou can get stomped by Obie\nYou 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me\nYou don't know me\nYou're too old\nLet go\nIt's over, nobody listens to techno\n\nNow let's go, just give me the signal\nI'll be there with a whole list full of new insults\nI've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil\nEver since Prince turned himself into a symbol\n\nBut sometimes the shit just seems\nEverybody only wants to discuss me\nSo this must mean I'm disgusting\nBut it's just me I'm just obscene\n\nNo, I'm not the first king of controversy\nI am the worst thing since Elvis Presley\nTo do black music so selfishly\nAnd use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)\n\nThere's a concept that works\n20 million other white rappers emerge\nBut no matter how many fish in the sea\nIt'd be so empty without me\n\nNow this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n\nI said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me\n'Cause we need a little

"title": "\"Like Toy Soldiers\"", "year": 2004, "lyrics": "Step by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down...\n\n[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down like toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart, we never win\nBut the battle wages on for toy soldiers\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\nEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nI ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\nEven if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\nI'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\nI'm supposed to set an example\nI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\nThere's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object for someone to get killed\nWhy would I wanna destroy something I help build\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin'\nAnd that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\nAnd talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\nWhile he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life\nLike fuck it i understand this is business\nAnd this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\nAnd wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\nBut now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\nThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\nIt's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\nFuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\nWell fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\nBut I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\nThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nThat's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nWe'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\nTo have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThen to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man\nIf ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\nCause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause\n\n[Chorus]"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/therealslimshady.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album": "\"The Marshall Mathers LP\"", "title": "\"The

know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now\nBut hey, what daddy always tell you?\nStraighten up little soldier\nStiffen up that upper lip\nWhat you crying about?\nYou got me.\n\nHailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad\nWhen I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\n'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?\nDaddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\nDaddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?\nYeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world\nWhen it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls\nTwo little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze\nI know it's confusing you\nDaddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us\nI don't see us ever being together ever again\nLike we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\n(Ha)\nIt's funny\nI remember back one year when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\nAnd stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me\n'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in\nEither kept getting broken into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\nAnd flew you and momma out to see me\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainnie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah\nIt's got a ring to it don't it?\nShh, mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me to\nDaddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every

became a hypocrite\nConcert after concert\n\nI was raking in the dough\nRolling in green\nHad the game hemmed up\nLike a sewing machine\nBut I was losing my freedom\nThere was no where for me\nTo not go and be seen\nAnd just go and be me\nAnd there was no in-between\nYou either loved it or hate it\n\nEvery CD critics gave it a 3, then 3\nYears later, they'd go back and re-rate it\nAnd call the Slim Shady LP the greatest\nThe Marshall Mathers was a classic\nThe Eminem Show was fantastic\nBut Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it\nI guess enough time just ain't passed, yet\nA couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic\nAnd eight years later, I'm still at it\nDivorce, re-married\nA felon\nA father\nSleeping pill addict\nAnd this is real talk\nI feel like the Incredible Hulk\nMy

think of all the shit I had to go through\nJust to get to where I'm at\nI've already told you at least\n\nA thousand times in these rhymes\nI appreciate the prayer, but I've already got\nGod on my side\nAnd it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?\nJust watchin' it from an opposite standpoint\nMan, boy's got to look\nNuts\nAnd that's the only word I can think of right now\nOn how\nTo describe

I tried to warn ya when you started\nNow your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of\nChainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust\nI never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but\n\nThere once was a saying that I used to say\nBack in the day when I met Dre\nI used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof\nThat if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof\nHe said \"What if you went platinum?\" I'd just laugh at him\nThat's not happening, that I can't fathom\nEighty-something million records worldwide later,\nI'm living in a house with a fucking elevator\n\nSorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it\nThey get so mad, when I call them both faggots\nall these fucking voices in my head I can't take it\nSomeone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it\nYou're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and\nTogether makes 'em a fucking bad combination\nI lashed at the doctor in my last operation\nShoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away\nsomebody please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him\nHomie, I'm the Schei\u00dfe, ask Doctor Dreizehn\nI can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son\nNo, not a-now, not a chance, not today son\nI can't believe I leave for one brief second\nAnd you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked\nAnd use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck

Amy Winehouse's teeth\nThen I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top\nStand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop\nWalk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop\nWhile I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!\n\nThere once was a saying that I used to say\nBack in the day when I met Dre\nI used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof\nThat if I

something a little less subtle,\nShove a fucking tonka truck up a little kids butthole,\nFeel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin\nI slash her in the ass with a icicle\nAnd leave her laying a blood bath\nWhile I put a catheter in\nAnd jump in the bath with her,\nIn my spiderman mask man\nJust imagine the fun I can have with a strap on,\nStick

doing chewing on a human,\nGrab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM!\nAssuming the fact that dudes in the back room\nUsing the bathroom vacuum and a racoon,\nSkewing a rat a cat screwing

nothing about her\nBeen to hell and back, I can show you vouchers\nI'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour\nMarried to the game but she broke her vows\nThat's why my bars are full of broken bottles\nAnd my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh.\nI think about more than I forget\nBut I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat\nAnd these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed\nBitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg\nMoney outweighing problems on a triple beam\nI'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh.\nBe good or be good at it\nFucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic\nYeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's \"fuck what they say\"\nI'm high as a bitch: up, up and away\nMan, I'll come down in a couple of days\nOK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode\nI got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code\nIt's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode\nAll about my dough but I don't even

again\nThey say the competition is stiff\nBut I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in\nI ain't never giving in again\nCaution to the wind, complete freedom\nLook at these rappers, how I treat them\nSo why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em\nThey call me a freak 'cause\nI like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them\nMan get these whack cocksuckers off stage\nWhere the fuck is Kanye when you need him?\nSnatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute\nYeah that rap was tight\nBut I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time\nSo you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um\nScribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit\nAnd start over from scratch and write new ones\nBut I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference\nWhen I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight\nIt's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump\nFrom the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow\nSet fire to the mic and ignite the crowd\nYou can see the sparks from hot metal\nCold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game\nI so started to rock fellow\nWhen I'm not even in my harshest\nYou can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow\n'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not gonna stop\nI'm standing on my Monopoly board\nThat means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop\n'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)\nWhen you're so good that you can't say it\n'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)\nPeople just get sick 'cause you spit\nThese fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore\nAnd you can never break my stride\nYou never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow\nYou'll never take my pride\nKilling the flow, slow venom and the opponent\nIs getting no mercy, mark my words\nAin't letting up, relentless\nI smell blood, I don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell\nWhere was you when I fell and needed help up?\nYou get no love\n\n[Eminem and Lil Wayne:]\nIt's a little too late to say that you're sorry

Boogie\nif it was the projects in Missouri?\ncause those're my best\nfriends until Isaac\ntook my tricycle and\nmy uncle Todd went to try to go get it back\nand ended up getting\njumped and cut in the gut with a\nswitch and 70-some stitches\nwhich is still, to this day\nwhy my mother still\ntries to show me some old fake picture\nof a fictitious little\nsister who never existed and this is why part of\nmy life's so twisted\nbut I can never be as\nsick as that bitch is\nand, by the way, that\npicture's one of my relatives\n\n[CHORUS] \nSometimes I feel like\nit's just me\nsometimes I feel

different about my brain that separates me\nfrom other players in this game? on the surface, it may\nseem like a scheme or some sort of scam\nfor me to get some damn sympathy\nbut that's the last thing\nI need is for people\nto walk around feeling\nsorry for me (me)\nand I'm not a G, never\nclaimed to be\nI gave my vest to\nCashis,\nhe'll need it more than me\nbut we'll see, cause we ain't

That's what I call the cost to splurge\nYou drive me bonkers, I\u2019m about to get my swerve on for sure\nThought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first\nDate cause I think I gave you power, when I gave you flowers in a vase\nA box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs\nProbably should've never let me call that job of yours\nTo talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work\nShould've been one of the first signs to cause alert\nMan we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her\nCause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me\nCause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love\n\n[Hook - Jamie N Commons:]\nYou know this ain't love, you know this ain't love\nYou know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)\nIt's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)\nIt's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)\n(And I here I go again)\n\n[Verse 2:]\nYou were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you\nTill I went to the lengths I did to meet you\nCause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning\nNow I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery, ah\nCause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you\nAnd I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in\nWe stuck to each other's hips and we can't\nDo anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone\nCan't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason\nThis definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you\nAnd you pretend to be as mentally and physically\nAddicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer\nDon't wanna be without you\nDon't wanna be with you neither, bitch\nPut me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek\nCause this ain't love\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nJust want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else\n\"What the fuck you whispering for?\nYou get on my nerves, you make me sick\nI think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz\nI mean it's time that we just split and leave the\nGames behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine\nI think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too\"\nGet the picture\nThat's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up\nTo the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's\nYou better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up\nI'm just mad the time it took to discover\nYou were using me for loot like I used you for looks\nOh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah\nToots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack\nBut I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back\nShe said, \"The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?\"\nShe grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head\nI barely ducked and that's right\nWhen she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe\nGirl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights\n\n[Hook]"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/groundhogday.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album": "\"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\"", "title": "\"Groundhog Day\"", "year": 2013, "lyrics": "What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare\n\nI used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious\n'Til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop\nAnd got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons\nThen we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching\nMissouri for Michigan didn't work\nSo we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan\nSomeone put me out my misery, I can't do this again\nMom please stick to a decision\nDiscipline, last thing I wanna do is listen she's like\nLex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Kryptonite\nSo the walls and I done lost my power to see through them bitches\nBut I run into them, running through the kitchen\nPretending to be blind Superman\n'Cause I had no supervision\nBut I did have a super power though\nI could turn into Invisible Kid\nDisappear out of sight, like a true magician\nAnd one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different\nMusic into the picture and it became my new religion\n\"I remember it clearly, even today.\"\nMove back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan\nAlways itchin' for something to do, was flipping\nThrough the radio stations one day\nAnd discovered this DJ who was mixing\nI say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard\nYou ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing\nI'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing\nFor shoes, fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops\nYou get the new LL Cool J cooling system\nMade that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in this\nThat's how I knew my mission\nLittle boom box boomin', spitting\nPracticing numerous rhythms\nWhen I sit in my room envisioning\nMy dreams come to fruition\nI remember Proof would visit\nCouldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go cuckoo ballistic\nGo through the roof for his shit\nIt's like we knew the instant\nWe touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit\nNever quit, too persistent\n\"We are the underground empire.\"\n\nStarted a group of misfits\nProof had a proposition\nIf we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit\nCome up with aliases, bipolar opposites and\nBe ready to come off the top as sharp position\nIf you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'\nThey'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you\nAnd you forgot your written\nOpportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again\nThey tried ding-dong ditching shit\nI fucking got that bitch in a headlock\nCut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin\nCock sucking cynder block in the wind\nNow I got my pot to piss in\nSpot in that top position\nCopping over the opposition\nLooking like a dog that's pissing\nLeg up on the competition\nPromising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson\nI'm in a league Muhammad's in\nAli's my colleague bombing them\nProbably end up on top of them\nStomping them like Ndamukong\nI'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson\nFlow vomits in your face\nCompetitors fall at my waist\nYou spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face\nSo name the time, place to battle\nBitch I'm still in that mind state\nDon't make me step on you and make you wine grapes\nCry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose\nBut you turds better be careful how you choose yours\n'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse\nAnd the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers\nNow where's your poop birds?\nOoh, no more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging\nWords of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers\nThe rap game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith\nSo let these words lift\n'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out\nEach verse is more merciless than the first is\nAnd you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served\nBlood thirst, Revenge of the Nerds\nChickit\n\n\"And it's true that you'll not escape my vengeance.\"\n\nAnd I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone\nWord to Uncle Ron\nI'm turning into a non-humble Don\nYou blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on\nSo start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on\nBetter back away from the front row, get launched\nShow you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo\nOn the fuckin' Jumbotron\nI'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaat\nI'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn\nSo mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass\nAnd I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap\nThe GOAT just ate eight acres,\nAn eighth of that was just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper\nOh look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked\nLike the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot\nCharred debris floating\nLike oak wood was burning\nReturn of the no good\nAnd I won't quit\n\n\"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below\nSomething that made Godzilla look like a plane.\"\n\nAnd I don't quit, won't change,\nIt's like a Groundhog's Day\nSo crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may\nSee if I popped your head\n\n\"I'm a heartless monster\"\nTurn me into\n\"I'm a heartless monster\"\n\"With my dick in your mouth all day\"\n\nI'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came\nBut the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed\nThere, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/beautifulpain.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327,

why\nWe can only get brighter\nThe further you put it behind ya\nBut right now I'm on the inside\nLookin' out, 'cause\n\n[Sia:]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\n[Eminem:]\nYesterday was the tornado warning\nToday's like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half\nYou wake in its wake to start the mourning process\nAnd rebuilding, you're still a work in progress\nToday's a whole new chapter\nIt's like an enormous asthma\nThunderstorm has passed ya\nYou weathered it and poked its eye out\nWith the thorn bush that you\nUsed to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed\nSo focused on the bright side\nThen you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner fast the more asserted\nNever looking back\nMay hit the curb\nBut every day is a new learning curve as you\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve\nBut you have to\nTo avert a disaster\nLucky no permanent damage\n'Cause they hurt you so bad\nIt's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant\n\n[Sia:]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI'm standin' in the

happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died\n'Cause you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive\nWhich means you will survive\nAlthough today you may weep 'cause you're weakened\nAnd everything seems so bleak and hopeless\nThe light that you're seekin'\nIt begins to seep in\nThat's the only thing keepin'\nYou from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end\nAnd I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing\nAnd by tomorrow\nYou may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after\nAll the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building\nAnd the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building\nYou're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down\n'Cause you're so over 'em\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\n\nAs time passes\nThings change every day\nBut wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same\nBut tomorrow today's going down in flames\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\n\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire\nFrom the heat\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\nIt's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\nBut you've extinguished this living hell\nStill a little piece of you dies as you scream\n\n[Sia:]\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn\nRising, a phoenix from the flames\nI have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine\nNot with fists, but with wings that I will fly\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/wickedways.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album": "\"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\"", "title":

Wisconsin\nThat's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?\nYou faggots are all gonna do my bidding\nDon't get dragged to the auction\nNeiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all\nI'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this\nStretched, tinted, black sedan my ass\nSee how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave\nIn a fucking taxi cab to go shopping\nAffable guy next door is laughable\nMy next whore's gonna have mechanical arms\nThat'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor\nNo emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard\nI got a Magic Johnson\nIt's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me\nIf Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out\nHolding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me\nI'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me\nHer flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around\nAnd all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse\nAnd Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist\nI slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony\nJust so happens she's fond of algae\nCause now she's faceplants on the concrete\nComplete lack of responsibility\nHalf you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit\nShit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop\nBut I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy\nKlepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now\nFive-finger discount\nBeen rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy\nKidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery\nRansom for JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit\n(\"Em\") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde\nI might relapse, get on some bullshit\nPerhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson\nMacklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth\nAnd have some back and forths\nAnd record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's \"Control\" verse\nAnd perform \"Fack\" in concert\n[\"Fack\" plays]\nYo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album\nNow that was awesome\nIt takes some massive balls to do some shit like that\nSometimes I have to ponder why people are like\n(I'll stick around)\nAnd put up with my crap so long for\nWhat's the attraction, mama?\nIs it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre\nOr the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?\nWho knows at this point, it's always poking so meh\nStill get along with this voice cause that's the monster\nSo do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that\nWhat they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh\nShe loves the way I lie\nSits on my face and waits for my nose to grow\nPathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole\nThat my disguise is pants, but they on fire\nSo am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off (fart sound)\nSabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking\nI'm wrapping up all the presents\nIn fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em\nJack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off\nWrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him\nBlowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond\nPut the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone, I\nKnow you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier\nBut classic rock acid rap is the genre\nGot Slash on guitar, splashing Bizarre, Thrasher and Aerosmith\nAnd I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula\nGodzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan\nBandwagoners, I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em\nSmack Kim Basinger on a ass...."}, {"url":

I finally realize how\nMuch reality sucks, but it's just something about our love\nI'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it\nAnd it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent\nAnd how I'll never hold you again\nAnd there ain't shit I can do about it\nNow my head is overcrowded\nWith these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it\nAnd how the fuck do you sleep comfortably\nKnowing what you done did to me, huh?\nDid it even occur to you that I loved you?\nCompletely, deep, and madly head over heels for you\nWas you and me, once used to be together forever\nIt was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream\nWe was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much\nWhen I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I\n\n[Chorus - Kobe:]\nSaw two

like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know\n\n[Eminem:]\nSometimes I feel like all I ever do is\nFind different ways to word the same, old song\nEver since I came along\nFrom the day the song called \"Hi, My Name Is\" dropped\n\nStarted thinkin' my name was Fault\n'Cause any time things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dog\n\nGangster? Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\" I pondered\nI just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\n\nYou keep pluggin', it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit so you know they're gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah\n\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story\nBet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are\nWhen I was afraid to\n\n[Sia:]\nI was a... afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out\nAfraid I'd never be found (my dream)\nI don't wanna go another round (but I won't)\n\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\n\nGuts over fear (the time is near)\nGuts over fear (might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me down\nNow I got guts over fear, guts over fear\n\n[Eminem:]\nFeels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know\n\n[Eminem:]\nI know what it was like, I was there once, single parents\nHate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\n\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on\nThat I made a spark, started to spit harder\nShit-learned how to harness it while the reins were off\n\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a fuck\"\nHaters started to appreciate my art\n\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park?\n\nAnd the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows\nAnd I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\n\nSo to the break of dawn\nHere I go recycling the same old song\nBut I'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\"\nThan make another motherfucking \"We Made You\", uh\n\nAnd I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just opened enough eyes later on\nGave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt\n\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells I was made to walk\nBut thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania\nSo when they empty that stadium\n'Least I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done\n\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk\nTake it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off\n\nThe legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a\n\n[Sia:]\nI was a... afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way o-o-out\nAfraid I'd never be found (my dream)\nI don't wanna go another round (but I won't)\n\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\n\nGuts over fear (the time is near)\nGuts over fear (might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me

seem to be reachin' in the crowds\nI'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening\nBut now it's, lay me down to sleeping\nIs it really my soul to keep or\nHave I sold it cheap is it greed\nDo I take

way\nPuting it but I like staying\nFeistier then a triceritops and like a dice player\nI got a nice pair of dice here\nSealed off in my lair\nAway from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit\nFrom in this house it's quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it\nAnd I feel so isolated, nice I made it\nBut it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it\nSo I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it\nThen I wonder why I stay famous\nKeep walkin' the line\nThis gold fish poke gets old\nBut especially when you don't know\nIf your conscience is sayin' I told you so\nYou don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier\nOr if you sold your soul\n\nIt's a fine, fine line\nIt's a fine, fine line\n\nAnd from here you look so small\nHovering high above us all\nPlease come back, to me\n\nI still remember the times when\nThey were, simpler than the rhymes of\nVanilla Ice were, when I was just killin' the mics\nI'll never forget what that feeling was like I,\nMiss those times now when I was just starting out\nWithout a dime and, now I'm diamond\nCan't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been\nStuck in this house hibernatin'\nHate even going outside it\nSucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'\nI just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it\nLook how excited, I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and\nEverything about it I miss\nWhich now reminds me\nPut a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz\nWow, I must have had Alzheimers\nLong time since I shouted them out, bout time\nCause it's been on my mind lately how\nZee you always supported me\nYou vouched, I will never forget that and\nHow you guys, accepted me for me and Pace\nI love you too, you slept on my couch\nAnd I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse\nRhyming is all we ever wanted to do\nAnd regardless how life has turned out\nInside I'll always be an outsider\nMy life has been turned inside out but I\n\nIt's a fine, fine line\nIt's a fine, fine line"}, {"url":

up in them streets\nCause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya\nPut a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River\nIf you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ\nKnow some killas pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller\nIf the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering\nThey say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'\nSo nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman\nHad K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Ketteran\nCough up a lung, 313 where I'm from\nGhan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son\nAny nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top\nIt's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody\n\n[Eminem:]\nLately it seems as if it's me against the world\nLike it was before my life became a movie\nAnd they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with\nBut I flipped that script like a refilla a\nPainkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal\nIt made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery\nAnd if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script\nAin't bein' conceited\nBut I made it to radio, eat a dick\nI still never ABC'D the shit\nMainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller\nSince before they called Jay Dee Dilla\nI was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit\nAnd if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here\nStill in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real\nDon't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler\nBreak all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer\nPeel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?\nFor me to flip\nWhat's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson\nWhen he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid\nOn the track get spanked like he just did\n(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch\nSick of bein' treated like me and shit\nBut Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features\nAnd them cyphers on BET cause if\nI wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit\nSeems to be reachin' it's fever pitch\nOne hundred and eighty degrees in here\nShoulder blade full of cedar chips\nMC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish\nOr Lorena with a two penises\nHateful and genius ness, inconvenience\nAnd for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life\nWhen I'm makin' you cling\nMay consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter\nCause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away\nBut ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond\nBut ain't we sick of bein' underdogs\nDon't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit\nMay even seem as if\nI'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit\nIs playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'\nAnd it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer\nSince the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter\nWith the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center\nIt's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again\nThe Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent\nAwaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger\nDid you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?\nAnd if they mention us\n\n[Dej Loaf:]\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little static\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\n[Trick Trick:]\nWhat up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody!

me\n\nIf I was frozen inside of a moment\nIf I could capture time inside a capsule\nAn hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it\nIf I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it\nThen I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it\nIf raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it\nThen I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks\nTo transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it\nAnd that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it\nYour passions too much for you to not be dancing to it\nAnd as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent\nYou're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish\nYou're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion\nTrue it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit\nUniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just\n\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\n\nCause when we descend together, we begin to move as one\nIn perfect unison just like the moon and sun\nIlluminate the room and humans soon become aluminum\nRhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun\nBut if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go\nRelax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow\nTo rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me\nIf I could give the world a hit of ecstasy\nTo make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute\nCause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished\nSo close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it\nThe sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite\nA high percentage of black people and white mixed in it\nBut no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'\nHis life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'\nLike life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it\n\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is

was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on\nMe that matters now's DeShaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question though\nEspecially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home\nIs burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtains drawn\nThey're closing the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final

words are more better heard\nThe world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours\nBut sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it\nI was there consolin' you when no one knew it\nWhen your situation showed no improvement\nI was that door, you walked over to it\nI'm the light at the end of tunnel\nSo people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it\nWhen that tunnel vision is

go down this road\nBut there's only one route to cross this bridge\nSo I walk in this bitch with loose change\n'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll\nBut it's never too late to start a new beginnin'\nThat goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?\nUse the tools you're given!\nOr you're gon' use the cards you're dealt\nAs an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?\nI used to play the loser/victim\n'Til I saw the way Proof was driven\nI found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet\nAnd when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets\nFanny packs, hourglasses\nIf time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste\nMan, in my younger days\nThat dream was so much fun to chase\nIt's like I'd run in place\nWhile this shit dangled in front of my

other's caps, for silly stuff like hats\"\nSingle mother strugglin' through substance abuse\nWhile people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes\nFuck your Republican views\nPull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?\nAnd streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics\nOr be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black\nYou better be strapped with a derringer\nOr be \"capped in America\" like Steve Rogers\n'Cause no one oversees these cops and\nAll we see is 'em beat charges\nWe done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off\nSo we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings\nJust keep marchin', 'til we reach congress\nBut they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance\nIf you try to slander the flag but\nSomebody has to be the sacrificial lamb\nSo they call it a Kaepernick tantrum\nIf you don't stand for the national anthem\nWe raise it, you better praise it\nOr you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll\nTreat you like Rodney Dangerfield\nHome of the brave is still racist 'ville\nSo this whole nation feels like a plantation field\nIn a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals\nThat had its Natives killed\nGot you singin' this star-spangled spiel\nTo a piece of cloth that represents the \"Land of the Free\" that made people slaves to build"}, {"url":

first time I saw you I actually said to myself, \"I gotta meet her like a taxi\"\nExactly, love affair in the backseat\nSorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue\nYou sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust\nMaybe I'm just ahead of myself\nLet me slow down, slow your Camaro\nI'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow\nGot me under your control and your spell\nWanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow\nGrab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem in fact\nAbout the only fact I agree on with Donald is that\nSo when I put this palm on your cat\nDon't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed\nWhy do you think they call it a snatch\nI just wanna climb in the sack\nI'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at\nI'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following in

brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit\nBut she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care\nWho knows, at least that isn't up in the air\nIt's something to see\nBut just like a girl who thinks her coochie doesn't stink\nIf she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve\nMaybe she wants to keep me company\nBut fuck the Pep\u00e9 Le Pew shit!\n\"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,\" I say to myself\nPlus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail\nLike a skunk in heat\nI could sweat her to some degree\nBut fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me\n(Could you repeat that again?)\nLet her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail\nFuck it, pull up beside her\nSideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her\nWhat is a brighter ass if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina?\nSaid my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her\nI said...\n\nAll day, all day, all night\nYou ask, I stay the night\nWith you, you say you're vile\nMe too, you're burning

knob\nWe be great together\nDon't care if it takes forever\nIf I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never\nYou felt my heat, rubbing off on you\nI love your personality\nCome on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat\nCome jump in the water, I bet you get your self esteem\nFrom your persona\nWith an ass to match, girl your body is lit\nYou're striking, I'm a gas\nGirl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner\nYou got puns, I got asperger's\nJust let me rest my head in between that set of Ds\nWhile I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese\nThat's just

true\n\n[Liz Rodrigues and Eminem:]\nI built this castle\nNow we are trapped on the throne\nI'm sorry we're alone\nI wrote my chapter\nYou'll turn the page when I'm gone\nI hope you'll sing

if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain\nA lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame\nI've said your name but always tried to hide your face\nThis game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang\nI never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it\nYou ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!\nThings that should've been private with me and your mother is public\nI can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it\nI'll put out this last album then I'm done with it\nOne-hundred percent finished\nFed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\nAnd if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote\nAs a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope\nI'm sliding down a slippery slope\nAnyways sweetie, I better go\nI'm getting sleepy, love, Dad\u2026 shit, I don't know"}, {"url":

machine\nI love you, Bean\nDidn't want you to know I was struggling\nFeels like I'm underwater\nSubmerged like a submarine\nJust heard that nurse say\nMy liver and kidneys aren't functioning\nBeen flirtatious with death\nSkirt-chasing, I guess\nIt's arrivederci\nSame nurse, just heard say\nThey're unplugging me\nAnd it's your birthday\nJade, I'm missing your birthday\nBaby girl, I'm sorry\nI fucking hate when you hurt, Hai\nAnd sweeties, thank you for waiting\nTo open gifts\nBut, girls, you can just open 'em\nDad ain't making it home for Christmas\nWish I had the strength to just blow a kiss\nI go to make a fist\nBut I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff\nI yell, but nothing comes out\nI'm crying inside, I shout\nMy vocal cords won't permit me\nI scream, but it's not aloud\nYou put your arm around mama\nTo calm her, wow\nI just thought about the aisle\nI'll never get to walk us down\nNever see you\nGraduate in your caps and gowns\nIt's 'bout to be 2008\nHow's this happening

school\nDoody, I'm trying, but you\nYou were the glue that binded\nSo many things, time\nI'd give anything to rewind it\nI had to walk down my halls\nAnd constantly be reminded\nBy pictures all on my walls\nAnd I couldn't sleep at night 'cause\nThat image burned in my brain\nOf you on the table\nMe falling across your body\nNot able to stand to save you\nGod, why did you take him?\nI'm tryna keep his legacy alive\nBut I'm dying, where's Nathan?\nLittle ladies, be brave\nTake care of your mother\nSmile pretty for pictures\nAlways cherish each other\nI'll always love ya\nAnd I'll be in the back

exchanging those sacred vows\nJust know that if I could be there, I would\nAnd should you ever see parenthood\nI know you'll be good at it\nOh, almost forgot to do something\nThank my father too\nI actually learnt a lot from you\nYou taught me what not to do\nAnd Mom, wish I'd have had the chance\nTo have one last heart-to-heart\nHonest and open talk to you\nDoody, I see you\nI go to walk to you\nAnd I can feel my soul leave my body\nAnd float across the room\nNurses lean over the bed\nPulling tubes out\nThen the sheet over my head\nShut the room down\nGirls, please don't get upset\nI see those cheeks soaking and wet\nAs you squeeze hold of my neck\nSo forcibly, don't wanna let\nMe go, pillow drenched\nEmotional wrecks\nWith every second each closer to death\nBut suddenly, I feel my heart\nBegin to beat slow, then a breath\nMachines go (beep, beep, beep)\nMust've guessed the cheat codes to this shit\nI'm tryna rewind time like a tape\nFind an escape\nMake a beeline\nTry and awake\nFrom this dream, I need to re-find\nMy inner strength\nTo remind me\nEven if a steep climb I must take\nTo rewrite a mistake\nI'm rewinding the tape\n\n(I don't want it)\nI'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it\nOne hundred percent finished, fed up with it\nI'm hanging it up, fuck it\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\nAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't\nI'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet\nShred these old letters I wrote\nAll that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll\nI'm proud to be back\nI'm 'bout to, like a rematch\nOutdo Relapse\nWith Recovery, Mathers LP2\nHelp propel me to\nVictory laps\nGas toward them and fast forward the past\nConsider the last four minutes as\nThat's the song I'd have sang to my daughters\nIf I'd have made it to the hospital\nLess than two hours later, but I fought it\nCame back like a boomerang on 'em\nNow a new day is

everything was totally new\nWe were globally huge\nWatching sales go through the roof\nWe wrote and we viewed it\nRunyon Avenue soldiers included\nA multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse\nWe were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth\nThought we was running shit till we lost the sole of our shoe\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\nAnd at the time I was going through my own struggles too\nSo I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\nI was hoping they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\nHow to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds\nI just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth\nCause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group\n\nIf I could leave this world behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nTurn to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom that I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nMay end up running back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nIt was never the same, and it's bothered me since\nAnd the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\nPlus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in\nThe debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin\nBut it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\nWhich reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit\nY'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit\nIf you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did\nMore than try talking you into coming up off of it\nI know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\nI think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers\nI wish that we would've politicked with\nMaybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\nBut that's water under the bridge\nBut I'm washing my sins in it till my concious is clear\n\nIf I could leave this world behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nTurn to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom that I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nMay end up running back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nBacardi in hand\nNever thought the party would end\nOne minute you're bodyin' shit but then your audience splits\nYou can already sense the climate is starting to shift\nTo these kids you no longer exist\nWent from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\nTo tiny drops full of drips\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\nYou start thinkin' of all the artists you gift\nAll the carnage you left\nIs this the kinda karma you get?\nFor turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift\nA Freudian slip\nSubconsciously, I honestly wished\nI ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\nBut it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this\nWish I had words\n\nBut I guess they're just for this\nStill, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\nI love all of you, men\nBut I just can't be the guy\nEverybody depends on for entire careers\n'Cause that's not even fair\nI will always be here\nBut that spark isn't there\nAnd I don't know how to recapture that time and that air\nI've tried hearkening back to\nBut I'm fighting for air\nI'm barely charting myself\nFeels like I'm under the sink\n\nBut it was not my intent\nTo treat y'all like a stepping stone\nThough I ain't left no one behind\nBut we been down every road\nDone all we possibly can\nI know we kept up our hopes\nBut the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\nThe less is left for closure, so let's let this go\nIt's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom that I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nMay end up running back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\nI never meant to

to work and serve MCs in the lunchline\nBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go\nWho must I show, to bust my flow\nWhere must I go, who must I know\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket\n'Cause I ain't having no luck with this little Rabbit's foot, fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm starting to doubt shit\nI'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold, trying to travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode\nMy defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one, this city is no fun\nThere is no sun, and it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doing I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn\nYo it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl\nI can no longer play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient, all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat, all I need is the words\nGot the urge, suddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occurred\nTime to show these Free World leaders the Three And A Third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road\n\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up, and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm going\nSorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/8milefreestyleptiivslotto.html", "artist": "Eminem",

[*imitating Slick Rick*]\nI put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs\nWe both drew at the same time and stood stunned\n(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)\nI figured he was telling the truth, that's why I didn't shoot\nSo what we gonna do, it's on you\n(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)\nThe Chronic!\n(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)\n(And plus I know who's got it)\nWho?\n(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)\nLoaded up my saddle, got ready for battle\nHid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel\nWe rolled two miles until we hit the spot\nAn old ghost town that everybody forgot\nA place where they used to smoke chronic a lot\nSlim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)\n\n[Eminem]\nThis is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless\nHe's going around saying he took the game from us\n(Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming)\nBut he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach\nHe's got mechanical legs, he spins webs\nPlus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads\nOur mission - is to get him to stop laying eggs\nAnd we can put him on his back down a flight of steps\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nI drew two guns, spun them on my fingers\nKicked the swinging doors in, started gun slinging\nI could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a \"G Thang,\"\nand a verse from \"Keep Their Heads Ringing\"\nI said \"It's Dre's Day,\" and started to spray\nAgainst 1800, he pulls a AK\nHollow tips started flying every which way\n\n[Eminem]\nThat's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge\nI fired the first shot, spun his body around\nHe hit the ground and landed upside down\nDre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold\nI grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\nAlways die..\nThe Wild..

fixing my problems\nWish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em\nBut the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles\nAnd why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me

the Shady franchise a push\nYou can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch\nJeans too small, least three pant sizes tush\nMushed against your damn side, your puss\nAnd thighs are squished\nWhat

Chapmans might just have to picket me\nLike a scab\nHard to describe in fact\nStartling violent perhaps\nAre things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that\nAnd you aren't

subside\nWe will subside and hatred will release\nAnd everything will just crush that peace\nWell, when we crush that peace, we start hatin' each other\nBut remember, you are my brother, and you are

again\nWanting to kiss a white kid\nSo she was my girlfriend, we started going out\nBut that's okay because we were Black and white\nBlacks and whites they sometimes mix\nBut Black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks\nSo I'ma say like this\nDon't date a Black girl, take it as a diss\nIf you want, but if you don't\nI'ma tell you like this, I surely won't\nNever date a Black girl

its green and that's cash\nSo get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass\nI said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore\nBlack girls and white girls just don't mix\nBecause

say to you\nI'm giving you a little advice\nDon't date a Black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice\nYou won't ever do it again because they'll take your money\nAnd that ain't funny\nSo I'ma say look honey\nI thought I said that before\nBut like I said again you're nothing but a big whore\nSo when mike catch on the bass line\nThat's okay 'cause we will not just waste time\n\nI'll get straight to the point\nBlack girls are bitches, that's why I'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches\n'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag\nFrom the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad\nI mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a Black guy\nAnd then you turn around and fuck another big, Black guy\nNow that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking\nBut that's okay because you need a

up in Eastland and shot a policeman\nFuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands\nthe shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan\nAnd for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than\nGrab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland\nSee I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan\nI'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin\nHurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin\nShot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin\nI want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan\nMaybe I need my head inside straightened\nBrain contemplatin, clean out the register\nDip before somebody catches ya\nor gets your description and sketches ya\nThe connection was the prime suspect\nBut I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet\nCause I got a daughter to feed\nAnd $200 ain't enough to water the seed\nThe best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King\nAnd have the lady at the desk bring\nmoney from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac\nCooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack\nThis bitch tried escapin the jack\nGrabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote\nYou barely heard a word as she choked\nIt wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked\nBut I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke\nJust then the pigs bust in yellin \"Freeze\"\nBut I'm already wanted for sellin ki's\nAnd bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees\nSo before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees\nI bust shots, they bust back\nHit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest\nLeft the house, pullin out the drive backin out\nBlew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out\nPulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face\nShut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp\nDrug her by her hair, smacked her up\nThinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up\nStole her car, made a profit\nGrabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window\nLike the girl in \"Set It Off\" did\nJetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal\nDrove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool\nClimbed out and collapsed on the patio\nI made it out alive but I'm injured badly though\nParents screamin: \"Son, go in and call the police\nTell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!\"\nTried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up\nRun in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff\nActin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before\nSmashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64\nWhen they sell out in stores the price triples\nI ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles\nand collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries\nThere goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties\nStood up and started to see stars\nToo many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars\nBarely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck\nJumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck\nBut I think somebody seen me maybe\nPlus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby\nFuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits\nCame out with a white flag hollerin \"TRUCE TRUCE\"\nand surrendered my weapon to cops\nWasn't

I can't\nSince honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try\nTry to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify\nAs a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride\nAnd say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize\nI think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines\nAnd thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds\nThen I'm like dollar signs\nBut I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke\nIs more of a knockout than Janay Rice\nPlay nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right\nIn the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight\nIn plain sight of the elevator surveillance\nTil her head is banged on the railing\nThen celebrate with the Ravens\nNever date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants\nI'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape\nThe aggression, rage and the anger\nCause they restraints on the ankles\nHeavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains\nThis ain't enough to contain it\nBut I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on\nStage in a fucking neglig\u00e9e everyday and Liz Claiborne\nDevastated from breakup with Kate Hudson\nWait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say\nCause makeup ain't gonna cover\nThat eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut\nPeppersprayed with your face cut\nMade my bank like a lay up\nOff these effing skanks on the way up\nOh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent\nIt's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches\nYes, I said seven, I measured it\nSeven inches from the floor\nWhile I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony\nAt the Sheradon when I'm stretching it\nBitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get\nSo if she's hesitant to get the hint\nI'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with\nHella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon\nWhen I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench\nExistential detriments to a lesbian devil\nIn the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level\nThat separatists like a Chechnian rebel\nImpressionist with a pencil\nA pessimist, with his lips pressed against\nThe edge of this Red Bull\nPedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever\nYou see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass\nSHADYXV as perplexing as\nThe last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse\nWhen I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird\nWhen I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears\nAnd these little Disney queers\nWho use chicks for beards?\nJust made that up too...\nOh and the Shady 2.0\nWe wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls\nCause it's supposed to confuse you hoes\nThe flows lose you as usual, so juvenile\n2 year old when I go to the studio\nIt's only music but don't be foolish though\nYou don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though\nIn my homie's Buick\nBeen known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it\nWhen I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do\nAnd I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart\nIn one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it\nYou couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it\nThe day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it\nRootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip\nWith the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women\nI'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot\nBut they consider me equivalent to chlamydia\nThey tryna get rid of me gadzooks\nBut I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag\nOf the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through\nAnd if I catch you doing anything\nHindering or prohibiting that after I give me that\nTattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally\nPickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!\n\nFuck it\n\nGot it somewhere in there probably"}, {"url": "https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/stimulate.html", "artist": "Eminem", "artistscore": 327, "album": "", "title": "\"Stimulate\"", "year": "", "lyrics": "Psst... hey, listen! \nLalalalala!
