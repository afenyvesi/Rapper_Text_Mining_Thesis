Little growin' boy of mine\\nWith a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime\\nHad no time for the growin' stage\\nHe learned his values on the streets at an early age \\nWatch for police, don't come home (why?)\\nCuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al\\n'Bout to have another baby \\nLike a rose from the concrete, growin' within\\nBlessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?\\nSo we began, closest family, such insanity\\nA happy home, from one act of inhumanity\\nPlus Mama said the seed was corrupted\\nUsed to rub Her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us\\nNow, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps\\nTurned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey) \\nHow could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?\\nShe ain't the cause of all the drama \\nCause Mama's just a little girl\\n\\n[Kimma Hill:]\\nMama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know)\\nMama's just a little girl \\nLivin' if she is or not\\nTime ain't on her side \\nCause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)\\nShe gotta hold her head up high \\n(How could she raise us) \\n\\n[2Pac:]\\nNow, will she remain in the same spot?\\nThe gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot\\nNow, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt\\nHer heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt\\nFulfilled prophecy\\nBut who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me\\nI'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse\\nWhat could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth\\nOnly functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in\\nPayin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin\\nI watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted\\nI wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it\\nThough we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried\\nWorried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery\\nMust be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares\\nNo! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share\\nIn this land of the underhanded schemes and plans\\nVivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand\\nMama told me not to be a punk\\nFuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want?

I'm askin\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n[Verse Three: Kadafi]\\nFaith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic\\nCause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets\\nWith they chest plates stretched like elastic\\nAnd what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin\\nHeard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block\\nJust came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck\\nwith a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize\\nIf you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked\\nTalk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard\\nOne of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him\\nHe said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure\\nCause he just came home off of bail\\n\\n[2Pac] Now tell me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n[Outro: spoken word]\\nWho do you believe in?\\nIs it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah?  Or Allah?\\nIs it Jesus?  Is it God?  Or is just yourself?\\nDefinately not to be imposed, being a demon\\nBecause this is the joy of believing!\\nMen, to believe in yourselves\\nBut for sure, the higher power\\nResides only to ride in the heart of the true\\nFrom the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi\\nIn the poetry, or in it's realm\\nThat's what pulls all words together\\nJust to understand, that every man, is his OWN man\\nAnd only man can satisfy the man\\nOnly the soul of the man, the feelings of the man\\nThe for realness of the man\\nYou can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man\\nAnd you gotta call yourself because you are that man\\n\\n[2Pac]\\nWho do you believe in?\\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin\\n\\n[singing while 2Pac speaks]\\nWho do you believe in?

Somebody else should try\\nCockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change\\nSo I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold\\nI'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe\\nCommunities in need of people that will lead\\nKeep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try\\nUntil the day I die, I promise to be wise\\nWith my heart open, greed brings only misery\\nAway the tragedy, so I stay sucker free\\nOnly a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise\\nDon't be afraid to try, too many of us die\\nFor the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise\\nStay focused on the prize, though everybody dies\\n\\n[Eminem:]\\nWe can only learn to take, our anger and our hate\\nControl our mental states, settle down and set it straight\\nMaybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes\\nBefore we said it, regret it later and let it escalate\\n'Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take\\nAnd there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate\\nTo the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes\\nYou think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes\\nBut we ain't, its grain to go against\\nWith every artist comes the image he portrays\\nAnd the picture that he paints\\nBut in the midst of all this anger and this angst\\nNever once did you heard me say I'm a gangster\\nAnd I ain't hear no complaints\\nBut I know that I will always continue to grow\\nAs long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow\\nThere will never be another me, and that I can guarantee\\nThat's why the fuck I remain sucker free\\nTo this day, the game will never be the same\\nNo matter how much fame and success they attain\\nThere will never be another me\\nAnd no matter what they do, there will never be another you\\nYou can search, but you'll never find\\nYou can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds\\nWe will never die, we are forever alive\\n\\n[2Pac:] And we continue growin', one day at a time\\n\\n[Young Noble:]\\nDon't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype\\nRappers are regular people minus money and lights\\nSearchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom\\nAll the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest\\nThere's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'\\nAnd the kids think beef is they only option\\nOutlawz born filthy, guilty as charged\\nMy memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on\\nYou think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns\\nAnd when your money is up, that's when your enemies come\\nSo if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?\\nWe needing a change, the drama remains the same\\n\\n[Hussein Fatal:]\\nI spend my whole life fightin' myself\\nThat I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help\\nAnd hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts\\nI'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt\\nYeah, that there is a fight in itself\\nSo I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself\\nNo matter how much I try, stay alive\\nI'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride\\n\\n[E.D.I. Mean:]\\nHeard frivolous beats, we past that\\nI'm tryin' to keep some income coming in\\nAnd collect on my ASCAP\\nThe rappers in the game ain't changed\\nAnd I finally realize that we're not in the same game\\nThe hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it\\nThem .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it\\nThe streets is military, you gotta be a soldier\\nGotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers\\nThey do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us\\nSo we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'\\nOne way at a time, keep the faith in your mind\\n\\n[2Pac:] And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn\",\n",
