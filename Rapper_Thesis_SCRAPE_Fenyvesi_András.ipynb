Hit them bricks and I\\'m a stalk like Michael, flip them chips I cut you off like Michael. \\n(Fresh dressed) \\nVersace frames on beam. Big boy chain with the 30 ground beats. Charcol-leather, new arrow with the stocking. Dope boy Z\\'s has got six back pockets. I rock J\\'s I got the custom made Ostrich, black cat jeans they hit me 4 the 800. Ain\\'t no thing we keep it crackin\\' all day. Dawg with U-hog trucks, we trappin\\' all day. When I hit that mall, I act pitiful. Y\\'all lay back the 6 tre goin\\' digital. Metro-park copped\\' Don Ed Hardy, popped two bars and throw a rock star party. I was lookin, feelin, like a million bucks, I was on that kush and dog it had me stuck.

Fans keep trying on guessing\\nMy record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it\\nBoi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it\\nAnd the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit\\nBoth of the deals, nothing under a mill\\nWe know you got it to give and we trying to collect it\\nLong as I got me some heat through the winter\\nDrake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners\\nBout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer\\nFor features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner\\nCause me and 1da trying to get at your girl\\nIf you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her\\n\\n[Hook x2]\\n\\n[Verse 2:]\\nCheck, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it\\nYou hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it\\nSo now you at the store for some blank CDs\\nYou can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it\\nCause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you\\nAnd I'll be the only one she concerned with\\nTo the people that ignored me before this\\nThis one is for you as a song re-recorded\\nFunny thing is, you just notice me now\\nBut I was here along your vision's just been distorted\\nI'm so throwed, [?] and I write a sixteen and record it\\nThe waiting is over I think music need it\\nDrake cuttin his records without gettin weeded\\nPeople in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude\\nThey expectations I'mma exceed it\\nLike a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it\\nWhen it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit\\nFinally here I'mma star with the timing\\nMy swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining\\nThis for anybody that's searchin for cash\\nAnd purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin\\nAnd so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne\\nMy pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy\\n\\n[Hook x2]\\n\\n[Verse 3:]\\nTwo years ago, a friend of mine\\nAsked me to kick some new school lines\\nAnd so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death\\nNow not signing me is something that the rest regret\\nThen I, hopped inside the Cadillac\\nThe chauffeur drove off and we never came back\\n\\n[Hook]\",\n",

At the same time I'm quick to forget.\\nI'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. \\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.\\nCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.\\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\\nWill I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?\\nI just need some closure. \\nAint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.\",\n",

It couldn't happen any quicker\\nY'all know them, but fuck it me either\\nBut point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer\\nIt wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds\\nWhen I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ah\\n\\n[Drake:]\\nI know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year\\nWho the fuck are y'all?\\nI swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back\\nBut I just can't remember it all\\nWhat am I doing, what am I doing?\\nOh, yeah, that's right.\\nI'm doing me, I'm doing me\\nI'm living life right now, man\\nAnd this what I'mma do 'til it's over\\n'Til it's over.

I'm just saying\\nI really can't complain. Everything is kosher\\nTwo thumbs up, ebert and roeper\\nI really can't see the end getting any closer\\nBut I'll probably still be the man when everything is over\\nSo I'm riding through the city with my high beams on\\nCan you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on\\nY'all just do not fit the picture\\nTurn your widescreen on\\nIf you thinking I'mma quit before I die dream on\\nMan, they treat me like a legend\\nAm I really this cold?\\nI'm really too young to be feeling this old\\nIt's about time you admit it. Who you kidding, man?\\nNobody's ever done it like I did it\\nAh\\n\\n[Drake:]\\nI know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year\\nWho the fuck are y'all?\\nI swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back\\nBut I just can't remember it all\\nWhat am I doing, what am I doing?\\nOh, yeah, that's right.\\nI'm doing me, I'm doing me\\nI'm living life right now, man\\nAnd this what I'mma do 'til it's over\\n'Til it's over.

So many different choices\\nToo many different opinions, too many different voices\\nWhat am I afriad of, just to say love?\\nI love you baby but, this is what I'm made of\\nAnd I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other\\nSo I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother\\nBut all I know is I already got one baby mother\\nAnd that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you\\n\\n[Chorus: Drake]\\nWhat am I afraid of?\\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\\nThey say - you promised me you would never change\\nOhh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh\\nYou promised me you would never change\\nOhh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)\\n\\n[Drake]\\nUhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on\\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on\\nNow that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on\\nI'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on\\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home\\nAnd I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone\\nBut hit redial, you'll see that I just called\\nSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all\\nAnd, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected\\nTextin sayin she wish she woulda kept it\\nThe one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it\\nMan I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's\\nLike I'm high right now, the guy right now\\nAnd you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now\\nThat nothin really comes as a surprise right now\\nCause we just havin the time of our lives right now\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n[Drake]\\nWell alright, uhh\\nI live by some advices girl, Lisa told me\\nThe other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me\\nUh, which made me question when I went missin\\nAnd when I start treatin my friends different\\nMaybe it was the fast-paced switch-up\\nOr the two guns in my face durin the stick-up\\nMaybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up\\nOr the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up\\nI know, but same time I'm quick to forget\\nI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets\\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh\\nCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed\\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\\nWill I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?\\nYeah.. I just need some closure\\nAin't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over\",\n",
